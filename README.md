# Assignment_5
Assignment5 for my python course
This repository contains two Python programs designed to demonstrate basic file handling techniques: reading, writing, and error handling in files.

## 🧠 Task 1: Student Marks Lookup

### ✅ Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2. Asks the user to input a student's name.
3. Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4. If the student’s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

### 🛠️ Program Functionality

- The program initializes a dictionary with some predefined student names and their corresponding marks.
- It prompts the user to enter a student's name.
- If the name exists in the dictionary, it displays the student's marks.
- If not, it informs the user that the student is not found.

### 📌 Example Output

'''bash
Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85

Enter the student's name: Bob
Student not found.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
Appends additional data to the same file.
Reads and displays the final content of the file.

🧠 Task 2: List Slicing and Reversal
✅ Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:
Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
Extracts the first five elements from the list.
Reverses these extracted elements.
Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

🛠️ Program Functionality
The program creates a list a containing numbers 1 through 10.
It extracts the first five elements into a new list b.
It then reverses list b into list c.
It prints the original list, the first five elements, and the reversed version.

🚀 How to Run Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x recommended). Download the script file. Open the cmd in the downloaded forder Run the script using the command: python Task1.py python Task2.py

This README.md should help users understand what the repository contains, how to use the files, and what each script does.
